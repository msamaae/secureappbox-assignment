# Frontend Developer Task

For this task, you have to write a simple application showing a thread of emails (a conversation
between 2 people). You need to retrieve the data from the endpoint provided below. There
should be a reply, forward and delete functionality.

Note: The API only has the GET method implemented, which means there is no reply, delete or
forward functionality implemented on the backend. You need to mock this in the frontend and
simulate the functionality as the endpoints were there (e.g. if the user deletes the message, it
can re-appear if the page is refreshed).

It’s up to you to decide the amount of features to implement and time spent on this task, but 3-4
hours should be enough for a successful applicant.
Implementation

1. You need to use Vue.js library to implement the task as the main focus is to check your
   Vue.js skills.

2. It will be a plus if you implement tests. It’s up to you the style and how exhaustive they
   are.

3. Some styling would be awesome but don’t spend too much time on it - we care about the
   logic and layout.

4. We use Git so should you, and it doesn’t matter what code hosting service you use
   (GitHub, Gitlab, etc.). We’d appreciate it if you didn’t mention SecureAppbox in your task
   if you decide to host it publicly.
